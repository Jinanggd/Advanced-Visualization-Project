# Advanced-Visualization-Project 

PENDING to be refracted

This is a project I did for a subject called Advanced Visualization at Universitat Pompeu Fabra which renders a 3D Scene with different types of illumination and shaders.
It is written in C++ with OpenGl libraries

# Installation

Before starting, you should have installed CMake on your PC ( https://cmake.org/download/ ). This allows you to compile the project depending of which O.S. you are running the project.
The project itself has a CMakeList.txt that tells the CMake how to compile the project.

Once you have installed CMake, in the folder StudentVersion create a subfolder called build and open CMake.
